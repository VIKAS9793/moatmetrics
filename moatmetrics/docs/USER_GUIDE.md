## ðŸŽ¯ **Advanced Features**

### **Confidence Scoring System**

MoatMetrics provides confidence scores (0.1-1.0) for every result:

#### **Understanding Confidence Levels**
- **High (0.9-1.0)**: ðŸŸ¢ **Trust completely** - Act on these results
- **Medium (0.7-0.89)**: ðŸŸ¡ **Generally reliable** - Safe to use for decisions
- **Low (0.5-0.69)**: ðŸŸ  **Use with caution** - Validate before major decisions
- **Very Low (<0.5)**: ðŸ”´ **Requires review** - Investigate data quality

#### **What Affects Confidence?**
1. **Data Completeness**: Missing data reduces confidence
2. **Data Quality**: Zeros, nulls, or outliers lower confidence
3. **Consistency**: Mismatched client names between files
4. **Recency**: Older data may be less reliable

#### **Improving Confidence Scores**
1. **Complete Data**: Ensure all required fields are filled
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use identical client names across all files
3. **Regular Updates**: Upload data frequently
4. **Validate Inputs**: Check data before uploading

### **Human-in-the-Loop Reviews**

When confidence scores are below your threshold, results are flagged for review.

#### **Review Process**
1. **Automatic Flagging**: Low-confidence results require approval
2. **Review Interface**: Access via `/api/governance/reviews`
3. **Investigation**: Check data sources and business context
4. **Decision**: Approve, reject, or request more data

#### **Review Criteria**
- **Low Confidence**: Below configured threshold (default: 0.7)
- **Business Rules**: Specific triggers (e.g., negative profit margins)
- **Data Anomalies**: Unusual patterns or outliers

### **Explanation System**

Every result includes human-readable explanations:

#### **Example Explanations**
```
"Strong profit margin of 24.5% indicates healthy client relationship. 
Based on $50,000 revenue and $37,750 in labor costs. 
Confidence: 85% (high data quality, minor time tracking gaps)"
```

```
"License utilization at 64% shows moderate efficiency. 
18 unused Microsoft 365 seats represent $216/month waste. 
Consider client seat optimization. Confidence: 92%"
```

```
"Staff utilization at 95% indicates high productivity but potential burnout risk. 
85% billable ratio is excellent. Consider capacity planning. 
Confidence: 78% (some time log gaps detected)"
```
